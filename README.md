# FocusBuddy

A distraction-free productivity tool built with a modern full-stack tech stack. This project is developed **solo** to sharpen my skills in building scalable, secure, and beautiful web applications.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** (App Router)
- **React 19**
- **TypeScript**
- **Material UI (MUI)** for component library and theming
- **Clerk** for authentication and protected routes
- **Supabase** for backend and database
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **shadcn/ui** for additional UI components
- **OpenAI API** integration
- **Emotion** for CSS-in-JS

---

## ✨ Features

- Modern authentication (Clerk) with protected routes
- Custom theming and global font (Raleway)
- Responsive, accessible, and animated UI (MUI + Tailwind)
- Clean, scalable codebase using best practices
- Solo project: all design, code, and architecture by me
- Security and performance focused
- Ready for CI/CD and cloud deployment
